<p>Malayan Railways Limited is the main rail operator in Peninsular Malaysia. 
The railway system dates back to the British colonial era, 
when it was first built to transport tin. Previously known as the Federated Malay States Railways (FMSR) and the Malayan Railway Administration (MRA), 
Kereta api Tanah Melayu acquired its current name in 1962.[1] The organisation was corporatised in 1992, but remains wholly owned by the Malaysian government. 
Fares are generally reasonable, but the low frequency of the intercity trains does not usually make them competitive with other modes of transportation.</p>
